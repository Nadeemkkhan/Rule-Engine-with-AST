# Rule Engine with AST

A simple rule engine built with Node.js and SQLite, allowing for rule creation, combination, and evaluation through a web interface. This application serves as a basic demonstration of a rule engine's functionalities and can be expanded for more complex use cases.

## Features

- **Rule Creation**: Define rules using a simple string format.
- **Combine Rules**: Combine multiple rules using logical operators.
- **Evaluate Rules**: Evaluate defined rules against provided data.
- **SQLite Database**: Stores created rules persistently.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- SQLite
- HTML

## Design Choices

- **Node.js**: Chosen for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, which is ideal for handling multiple requests efficiently.
- **SQLite**: A lightweight database solution was selected for its simplicity and ease of use, making it suitable for small to medium-sized applications.
- **Express.js**: This framework was used to simplify routing and middleware management, allowing for a clean structure in handling HTTP requests.
- **Modular Code Structure**: The application is designed with modularity in mind, separating concerns between different functionalities (e.g., rule creation, evaluation).
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling is implemented to provide feedback for database operations and rule evaluations, ensuring a smoother user experience.
  
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
